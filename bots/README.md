Subdirectory containing javascript bots.

I am the original creator of the following bots:
- DoubleDong bot for csgodouble.com

The files "botSomething.js" are the current versions, anything named "botSomethingX.X.X" is for history sake and should not be used.

The file "botSomething.txt" contains information about what is to come in future releases.
